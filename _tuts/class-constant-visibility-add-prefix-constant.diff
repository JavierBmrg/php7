 ## Class constant visibility
 
-* !! Went over all the code, and can't see a good example. The best one would be to take some "hard-coded" value, and use a constant for that (thought with the current code it's unnecessary).
+**Class constant visibility: Add prefix constant**
+
 * Constants are a great way to re-use a value without getting into bad practices like using global variables
-    - Show `GenusController::98`
+    - Show `GenusController::133` (line with `'avatarUri' => '/images/'.$note->getUserAvatarFilename(),`)
     - `/images/` string is a great example of a value that could be extracted into a constant. That way if we change the location of our images it would require only a single change.
-    - in `GenusNote::13` add `const AVATAR_FILE_PREFIX = '/images/';`
-    - in `GenusController::98` replace the line with `'avatarUri' => GenusNote::AVATAR_FILE_PREFIX.$note->getUserAvatarFilename(),`
+    - Open `http://localhost:8080/genus/hippocampus` to show how notes look right now
+    - Edit `GenusController::133` replace `/images/` with `GenusNote::AVATAR_FILE_PREFIX`
+    - Using IDE create a constant `const AVATAR_FILE_PREFIX = '/images/';`
+    - Refresh page to show that it still works like before
+
 * The new change in PHP7 is that you can change the visibility of constants (like with methods/variables).
     - To make sure what we don't introduce some errors by manually typing the URI, let's introduce the method to get the URI
         + Add `private const BLANK_AVATAR_FILENAME = 'blank.jpg';` in `GenusNote::15`
